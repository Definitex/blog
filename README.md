## Tokenbrice.xyz, a blog respecting your privacy

> I made this blog as a callout: I'm no dev, I can barely code, and yet I was able to respect my reader's privacy, to an unprecedented level in the space.

To do so, TokenBrice.xyz relies on **open source frameworks** and solutions such as Hugo (rendering of the blog) or Matomo (privacy-conscious analytics).

For those interested, this blog implements **full IP anonymisation, cookies non-propagation** in compliance with the [CNIL guidelines](https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/typo/document/Configuration_piwik.pdf) - an independent French' administrative body acting as a privacy watchdog.

Tokenbrice.xyz is also replicated on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/). I'm not entirely happy with the infrastructure just yet, but I think it's significant progress compared to most existing websites:
