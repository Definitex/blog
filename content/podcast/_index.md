![Abel Abstracts - Weekly DeFi Catchup with TokenBrice](/img/others/abel-abstracts.jpeg)

## Concept

This page organises this curated content registry following the order of the mentions in the DeFi Catchup.

Every week, Abel and I catch up and go over the new releases in the DeFi space, as well the articles & insights that caught our attention. We keep it incremental and try to provide context on each of the topics we approach, as well as resources for our listeners to explore a given topic further.

On top of the weekly catchup, Abel also publishes insightful interviews with key actors of whole web3 ecosystem in his podcast: **[üéô Abel's Abstracts - Anchor.FM](https://anchor.fm/abelsabstracts)**.
