We understand this is something many IT professionals experience, which led us to write a series of guides to help technical profiles (actually any profile) to spy before signing. The five articles of the series are full of different pieces of advice and little tricks to evaluate many aspects of a company. They will also help you to gather a huge amount of intel in order to be in a position of power when contract negotiations start.



It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre actively looking for permanent or freelance contracts, or if you‚Äôre an intern who just received a job offer ‚Äì the guides will help any of you with advice tailored to any situation. They are based on our startup and tech domain experience.



## Spy before you sign



To start, we‚Äôd suggest to [evaluate the development processes and chosen technologies]({{< relref "csg-tech.md" >}}). This is mostly interesting to engineers, but could also help others.



Once you‚Äôre sure of the basics ‚Äì a solide product/service ‚Äì it‚Äôs time to check the infrastructures in place to get the product out into the world and sell it. That‚Äôs the goal of the second articles: [one to evaluate the marketing efforts without putting a foot inside the company]({{< relref "csg-mkt1.md" >}}) and [one that helps to evaluate internal processes and methodologies]({{< relref "csg-mkt2.md" >}}) in case you‚Äôve access to it.



After having an idea about the technical and commercial sides, there‚Äôs still one big question mark in the room: who are the actual people you‚Äôll work with? Our last guide advises you on [how to get a feel of the atmosphere and your potential colleagues]({{< relref "csg-hr.md" >}}).



## Be ahead during negotiations



After having filtered through numerous companies, you‚Äôll probably have found one that matches your expectations. The next step will be interviews and negotiations.



No matter the job, you always need to negotiate. Unfortunately, not many companies offer you a deal that exactly represents your value. On top of that, you might have expectations that can‚Äôt be foreseen.



Before even starting to analyse the different steps of the negotiation, one thing that‚Äôs always true: only believe what‚Äôs written in your contract. Anything mentioned orally during discussions is worth nothing. Always keep in mind that the one making the promise will often not be the one that needs to execute it.



### The salary



The salary is obviously the heart of the negotiation. As a developer, you‚Äôll find many indicators around the web that will tell you how much your combination of mastered technologies is worth.

While these articles and studies help you to understand the most trendy coding languages, they don‚Äôt really help you with your salary negotiations. They are often too optimistic (especially as if you‚Äôre a Junior).



Sorry to disappoint you, but you‚Äôll probably need at least some years of experience until you‚Äôll earn 100k‚Ç¨ + per year. Truth is experience and language type are just two of the numerous variables defining a salary. Others would be your position in the development team or simply the location.



### You‚Äôre the reference



A better benchmark is much more valuable and easier to find: your previous salaries. There‚Äôs no rule that says x years of experience = y % salary increase, but it‚Äôs always a good fact on which you can base yourself on.



It is important to note that the first number you spit out is crucial. It should always contain a margin (around 10% more) in order to be able to negotiate. If you start with your bare minimum, it will be harder to make a good deal.



### Bonus per objectif



Bonuses are often used to compensate an otherwise minimal salary. The most important rule applies especially for this aspect: Do not believe anything that‚Äôs not written in your contract. If the bonuses are based on objectives that ‚Äúwill be defined once you start the position‚Äù, it might just be a tactic to hire you with a lower salary.



The same goes for impossible objectives you might never be able to attain and thus never be paid for. And once you‚Äôve signed, it will be much harder to contest those objectives.



#### Potential increases



To make a low salary look better there are more tactics than the one mentioned above. One big classic are future salary raises. They usually do not involve any commitment by the person declaring them.



For software engineers, this resembles to ‚Äúin 1/2/3 years, you‚Äôll be CTO/Lead-Dev/Rockstar‚Äù. It‚Äôs really hard to judge the depth of such promises ‚Äì don‚Äôt let them impact your choice.



## It‚Äôs time to negotiate



Before signing the contract, you have the most leverage, so do not waste this momentum. Once you‚Äôre hired, it‚Äôs difficult to negotiate new terms. So be prepared, with every intel possible and as always, never forget rule #1: do not believe anything that‚Äôs not written in your contract. The only way to be sure about what you‚Äôll get is to eternalise your desires in white and black on paper.
