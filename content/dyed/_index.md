You've heard about decentralised finance, but stayed on the sidelines? It's now time to go West, and the occasion is unique:
I will be training one of my colleagues for 3 months, so why not you too?

## Why Me?

I'm not the savviest technical expert of DeFi but there is no need. What matters for this program is to be able to articulate DeFi's comprehensively to an outsider, and I've been doing this a lot already and always looking to improve. I've been around for a while and I'm laser-focused on the community.

I was increasingly getting worried about seeing the behaviour of the new entrants in the space. Then I looked at the media they were consuming and I understood - profit is the sole driver of most publication of the space.

So how about we fix this ourselves? How? **Simple, we get money out of the equation.** Just like my other initiatives, DYED is free. The main "expense" is a few hours of my time a week √ç'm glad to dedicate to the community.

Let's grow and learn together!
