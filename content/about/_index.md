I'm working to grow the Ethereum decentralized finance ecosystem by developing welcoming communities.

I'm currently involved with Monolith as our Community Manager. I help maximize our brand visibility and awareness, both online and offline: events, community podcasts & media, social media, Discord, Reddit, Telegram groups essentially.

I'm also the co-organiser of DeFi France, the most successful decentralized finance grassroots meetup in Europe.

Since the beginning of my career, I've worked with startups and helped them grow their presence online by designing and enforcing strategies enabling them to harness the long-lasting exposure SEO can deliver.

Feel free to reach out to chat about Ethereum & decentralised finance.
