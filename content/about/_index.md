I'm working to grow the Ethereum decentralized finance ecosystem by developing welcoming communities:

|  Logo | Project | Description | Function |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  ![monolith-logo-h](/img/others/monolith-h.png) | [💳 Monolith](https://monolith.xyz) | Shaping the future of payments with the world first non-custodial contract wallet paired with a Visa debit card. | Community Strategist |
|  ![DeFiFrance-logo](/img/others/defifrance.jpg) | [🇫🇷 DeFi France](https://t.me/defifrance) | The original and leading grassroots Decentralised Finance meetup in Europe, held entirely in French to broaden accessibility. <br> [➡More info on the dedicated French page]({{< relref path="_index.fr.md" lang="fr" >}}) | Co-Organiser |
|  - | TBD | Making the top ressources about DeFi accessible to non-English readers | FR Coordinator |

I'm currently involved with Monolith as our Community Strategist. I help maximize our brand visibility and awareness, both online and offline using any relevant support (article, video, podcast, meetup) and channels (mainly Twitter, Telegram, Reddit). 

I'm also the co-organiser of DeFi France, the most successful decentralized finance grassroots meetup in Europe.

Since the beginning of my career, I've worked with startups and helped them grow their online presence by designing and enforcing strategies enabling them to harness the long-lasting exposure SEO can deliver.

Feel free to reach out to chat about Ethereum, DeFi & any other topics discussed on this blog.
